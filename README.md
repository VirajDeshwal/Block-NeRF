# Block-NeRF(Under Development)
You can check my tring in multinerf with Block-NeRF data (https://github.com/hjxwhy/multinerf/tree/block_dev), 
This project is the non-official PyTorch implementation of Block-NeRF.
I am sorry I have delete the branch `block_pl`, because the author decide not to open source. I will continue develop if I have time.
